I broke my Chinese speed clamp, so i fixed it with my 3d printer.

Not sure who manufacture it because i see this one a lot rebranded over eBay.

May this model can help someone anyway, looks like i'm not the only guy who had this [problem](http://softsolder.com/2011/11/04/harbor-freight-bar-clamp-failure/)
